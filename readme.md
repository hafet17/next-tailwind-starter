## Deploy your own
You'll want to fork this repository and deploy your own Next.js website. You can do a one-click
deploy with the button below.

[![Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/project?template=riipandi/next-tailwind-starter)

Once you have an image generator that sparks joy, you can setup [automatic GitHub](https://vercel.com/github) 
deployments so that pushing to master will deploy to production! ðŸš€
